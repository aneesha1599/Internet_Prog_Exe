    <b>
Stratford-upon-Avon</b> is not an ancient town by English standards. Although the Romans built a road through Stratford, a permanent settlement did not appear until the Middle Ages.

The Anglian Tribe the Hwiccas (a Germanic tribe that settled after the Romans) were the first Stratfordians. Around the sixth century their settlement was absorbed into the Angelo-Saxon Kingdom, explaining the Saxon entomology of ‘Stratford-upon-Avon’.

Between 693 and 717 the first explicitly written reference to Stratford appears, naming the town as ‘Aet-Stratford the isles of the ford’. Presumably it was the establishment of Holy Trinity Church that drew written attention. Stratford then consisted of the church, a monastery, a watermill, and a flourishing community of about 20 families. Unfortunately little survives of the first Stratfordians, as Danish raiders burnt every house in Warwickshire in 1015.</body>
